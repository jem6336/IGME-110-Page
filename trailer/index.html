      For Honor is one of my favorite games in the past several years. While the mulitplayer is what everyone talks about in the game and plays for the most part, I believe that the campaign has been very overlooked by the community.
      I decided to make this trailer featuring cutscenes from the campaign and cinematic trailer as a way to advertise it. The game revolves around three factions: Knights, Vikings, and Samurai, so I wanted to make sure that each
      was featured in the trailer as well as the game's overarching theme of all out war. While the first transitions are a bit rocky, they got better as I got better throughout the trailer.
